#### People

- American influences are present everywhere:
  - Consumerism is rife. Malls are go-to attractions and ridiculously large (Chinese-owned generally)
  - Everyone is bilingual (English and some Filipino dialect)
  - Feet instead of meters
  - Lots of fast food chains (McDonalds, Starbucks, Burger Kings, KFC, etc.)
  - People's names tend to be American or Hispanic (Juliet, Uriel, lots of Jrs. etc.)
  - There are heavy ties to Catholicism
- Families are big and nuclear. A cab driver mentioned that his neighbor had 24 children.
- Many people kept telling Sam and I that we should find Filipino girlfriends. There seems like a strong push for Filipino girls to find Western men with money
- Filipinos don't look homogenous. There are many different influences (Chinese, Malay, Spanish)
- People usually have a big smile. Children often waved and smiled at foreigners
- There is generally no scamming. People seemed to be pretty honest
- Lots of young men. Beehive demographics
- People are on island time. They're rarely stressed

#### Work

- At every work place, there are about 6x too many workers. Most are just sitting around and not doing much
- The upper-level job for college graduates or trained people work as call-center operators and virtual assistants. A lot of people work for European/American companies and working overnight
- Lots of people in higher education. However questionable how skilled they are afterwards

#### Transportation & Infrastructure

- Transportation is eccentric. Jeepney's look like they should be in Mad Max. Tuk Tuk's are ubiquitous and religiously decorated. Scooters run the roads.
- Transportation between islands was onerous. Airports were somewhat difficult to navigate and traffic was often intense
- Even in the center of some towns, roads were unpaved
- Tourist infrastructure is still emerging. Prices were cheap for food and hostels. Swam with whale sharks for $8
- Electrical cables were spiraled everywhere

#### Misc

- There were two types of beer on the whole island. Not many imports overall
- People like to have a good time. Karaoke is the national pastime. Lots of partying
- Underlying tensions between Muslims and Christians. There is an entire Filipino island that is Muslim and off-limits to travelers
- Almost every dish is served with rice. There are fewer noodle and broth dishes than most Asian countries.
- There were an insane number of stray dogs and cats. Many are ill and malnourished.
- Urban cities are dirty. There are a fair amount of homeless and impoverished. Per capita GDP still very low
- Palm trees, beaches, humidity, heat
