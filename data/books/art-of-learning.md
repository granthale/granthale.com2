This book is what self-help books aspire to be. It's practical yet thought provoking, providing much more than just an approach to learning more effectively. A way to see this is through Josh's notion of quality - a high level of presence and enjoyment in all aspects of life - which helps reinforce further quality in learning and competition.

This book is paired well with *Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance* by Robert Pirsig which introduces the notion of quality that Josh develops.
