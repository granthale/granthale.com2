summary: "When asked to explain our behavior, our reasons often don't fully match up with our motives. This is because, during our evolution, it has been advantageous to deceive others for selfish gain. To do so more effectively, we often hide these true motives from ourselves. This can be problematic, especially on an institutional level."
