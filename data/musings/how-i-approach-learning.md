**Notes to self:**

1. Choose to learn things that are directly useful, or I am willing to spend time with
2. Take notes, highlight memorable sections in Kindle
3. Create SRS prompts while reading and later as I review my notes
4. Write evergreen style pieces with original thoughts
5. Continue to review SRS prompts and Readwise highlights

**Details coming soon...**
