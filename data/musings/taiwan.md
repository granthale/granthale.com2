Taiwan was far less developed than I thought it would be and was great because of it. There were a prolific number of motorcycles, noodles, and night markets.

**Here are the main cultural differences that I noticed during my 12 days there:**

#### Appearance and weather

- Some parts are much more run down than Japan and most of the US. Many buildings look pretty old.
- So many billboards of politicians running for office or attractive women. Not much else.
- Super, super humid. I got used to sweating constantly.

#### Transportation

- One-time train passes are plastic coins that are dispensed from a machine and that scan you on.
- All of the transportation systems were on one card (trains, bus, bike). This is super convenient.
- Buses are somewhat predictable, although didn't show up a few times.
- No sidewalks on many streets (supposedly there were protests about this).
- Where there are sidewalks, they're often overrun with shops or stalls making it very difficult to lug a suitcase around.
- Lots of traffic police at many of the major intersections.
- Bullet trains are very smooth. You can get from one side of the island to the other in <3 hours.
Tons and tons of scooters, about the same ratio as cars.

#### Food & Commerce

- Tons of food markets everywhere. They have a wide variety of delicious fried foods.
- Food is mostly rice/noodle based. One of the staple dishes is Beef Noodle Soup and it's ridiculously good. I ate it at least every other day, sometimes twice in the same day.
- Prices are relatively cheap. About 6 USD for a good meal. About $10-20 for a night in a hostel.
- Iced coffee is sealed similar to bubble tea so that it can be shaken to ice down.
- 7-Elevens are similar to Japans in terms of quality and offerings - they have some unique things like Tea-boiled eggs.

#### People

- Many less foreigners than Japan.
- Most older people don't speak english. Many younger ones do.
- Out of all of the students and professionals that I saw, I don't remember seeing any Macbooks. A lot of iPads and iPhones though.
- More open muscularity than Japan, but still not much.
- People are friendly and willing to help.

#### Misc

- The culture is less conservative than Japan. They're more open to having one's shirt off.
- I could often hear air force jets flying overhead. Supposedly in Hualien, this was every 5 minutes.
- The east side of the island is much less urban than the west.
- Most of the cities are very quiet at night. I was always surprised by the number of people that actually lived in the city vs. how many people I saw.
- A typhoon was taken in stride. I guess it comes with the territory as an island nation.
- Lots of wild dogs. Saw 11 within 20 minutes at one point.
