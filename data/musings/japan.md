Japan was one of the most interesting countries that I've ever been to. It was incredibly first-world, austere, kind and unique.

**Here are the main cultural differences that I noticed during my two weeks there:**

#### Social Etiquette

- Everyone is friendly and willing to help. There is no distrust at all when you go up to someone to ask help for directions.
- Instead of saying "thank you" when someone holds the door, the polite response is akin to "sorry for inconveniencing you". The exact phrase is "sumimasen" which translates to "excuse me".
- When train platforms are busy, people still line up in straight lines and wait their turn. Orderliness is off the charts.
- No one jaywalks. It is looked down upon and a finable offense.
- No one stares or makes eye contact. There is no outward judgement whatsoever. This is in contrast to the western people that I saw, who noticably look at you for much longer.
- However, since leaving the country, I've now heard from multiple people that internal judgements are common. It's difficult for foreigners to ever be fully accepted.
- Bowing is the default greeting/goodbye instead of shaking hands.

#### Public spaces

- Most public spaces are extremely quiet. Not many people talk on the trains. In general, the cities are extremely quiet, even though there seems to be a lot happening.
- There are no public trash cans! People hold on to their trash until they are home or throw it away at the restaurant or convenience store that they bought it from.
- Littering is non-existent. Even cigarettes are placed carefully in the trash.
- Lots of gravel is used in public playgrounds and public spaces. Rock gardens are somewhat common.

#### Public transport

- When entering subways, the gates are open until you try to enter without a ticket. Then they slam shut. This gives the system an "innocent until proven guilty" feel.
- For the trains, tickets are swiped when you enter and when you exit. Most American cities only require 1x tap when you get on.
- One would expect a "sumimasen" when someone squeezes past you on trains or restaurants, but no. Only silence. Seems more utilitarian than consistently saying excuse me.

#### Commerce and dining

- When paying for something, money is never handed directly to someone. It is always put into a little basket first.
- Unbelievable food at the convenience stores. The 7-Eleven's in particular blow the US out of the water.
- Wet napkin provided for before and after meal. No napkins for during meals at most restaurants.

#### Cultural traditions and beliefs

- Bath houses (onsens) seem sacred in many ways. No cell phones are used inside.
- Nudity is completely normal in onsens, but in public spaces, no one would take even their shirt off to exercise.

#### Misc

- Not many people are openly muscular. I saw very few men that looked like the American ideal, and many of them were pulling rickshaws. It seems like our body image complex is embedded deeply in our culture.
- In bathrooms, people bring their own handkerchiefs to dry their hands. There is no paper towels. I'm wondering if this is remnants of an American tradition?
- Elevators actually close when you push the close door button.
- Little anime-like characters are used everywhere. Even in what we could consider serious settings like depicting police.
