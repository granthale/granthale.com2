### Goals

To learn. To develop a system that brings ideas back into attention that would otherwise have been lost to the [forgetting curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve). To be able to explain to people what it is that you're learning about and why they should care.

### Process

1. [Consciously commit]() to learning about something for a set amount of time (shorter when initially digging in, longer as time goes on). Decide when to reconsider whether or not it's worth continuing. Be at peace with the fear of missing out that committing creates.

2. [Take raw notes](https://granthale.com/books) while consuming. Highlight memorable ideas in Kindle or Reader.

    - Writing raw notes helps keep auto-pilot at bay. It takes a few second to think through and put something in your own words.
    - After finishing a chapter/section is a great time to do this. Try to recall what the most important points are that you just consumed. Imagine explaining it to someone. Then go back and fill in whatever details you were missing.
    - This step can be inconvenient while traveling or away from a laptop. It isn't fully necessary but it helps you to initially process everything and to have something to look back at in the future.

3. Create [spaced repetition prompts]() (I use Anki) of important points while consuming and looking back over notes/original texts.

    - Spaced repetition is often maligned with remembering rote details. However, it can be treated like note taking for things that you want to remember. The notes are then in the form of questions and answers instead of just statements. See [Michael Nielsen's demonstration of this](http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html).

4. Spend time off-line, writing [evergreen-style]() notes with original thoughts. At this point, shift from note-taking to note-making, from consuming information to creating knowledge.

5. [Allow ideas to marinate](). Review Anki prompts and Readwise daily.

    - This is the most underrated aspect of spaced repetition. We are what we think about. Prompts become the ideal way to consistently bring attention back to the ideas we want to be thinking about.

Throughout: [Go on walks](). Think things through without the source material at hand. Ask questions and answer them. Talk to others. Podcast. Tweet. Solve problems. Apply the material. 

### Misc thoughts

 I've often found myself passively going through these steps, especially when tired. While I don't think it's bad to continue to work when we're not fully there*, it can often be useful to take breaks or choose to [work on other things](https://jakobgreenfeld.com/personal-productivity).

*I find it a useful time for first-reads and scaffold-building.
