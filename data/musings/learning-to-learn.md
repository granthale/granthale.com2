*WIP. Most links are not currently active.*

1. [Consciously commit]() to what I'm learning for a set amount of time (shorter when initially digging in, longer as time goes on). Decide when I'll reconsider whether or not it's worth continuing. Be at peace with the fear of missing out that committing creates.

2. [Take raw notes](https://granthale.com/books) as I go. Highlight memorable ideas in Kindle or Reader.

    - Writing raw notes helps keep me from going on auto-pilot when reading. It makes me take a second to think through and put something in my own words.
    - After finishing a chapter is a good time to do this. It helps to try to recall what it is that you just read. Then I go back to fill in whatever I missed.
    - This can be inconvenient while traveling or away from a laptop, and isn't fully necessary but it helps me read more effectively.

3. Create [spaced repetition prompts]() of important points while reading and while looking back over notes/ideas.

    - This can almost be treated like notetaking for things that you want to remember. See [Michael Nielsen's post on this](http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html).

4. Spend time off-line, writing [evergreen-style]() notes with original thoughts (shifting from note-taking to note-making, from consuming information to creating knowledge).

5. [Allow ideas to marinate over time](). Review Anki prompts and Readwise daily.

    - Reviewing is not only a way to remember things. It's also a way to keep things you want to keep thinking about front-and-center.

Throughout: [Go on walks](). Podcast. Tweet. Think things through. Talk to others. Solve problems. Apply the material. Come up with questions and answer them.
