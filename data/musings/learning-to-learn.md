Most schools never explictly teach us how to learn. That's pretty incredible given that many of us spend 19-20 years in them.

Two examples. One, they don't teach us how to remember something for as long as we would like. And two, they don't teach us how to learn on our own, outside the classroom.

Those things are hinted at, but the ability to do them well is often seen as a trait that we have or that we don't. Geniuses seem to be geniuses and we're just, well us.

In the last few weeks, I've realized how false that is. Below is a system incorporating what I've thus far learned about learning. I hope you find it useful.

### Goals

To learn. To develop a system that brings ideas back into attention that would otherwise have been lost to the [forgetting curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve). To be able to explain to people what it is that you're learning and why they should care. To think creatively and originally. To make memory a choice.

### Process

1. [Consciously commit](/) to learning about something for a set amount of time (shorter when initially digging in, longer as time goes on). Decide when to reconsider whether or not it's worth continuing. Be at peace with the fear of missing out that committing creates.

2. [Take raw notes](https://granthale.com/books) while consuming. Highlight memorable ideas in Kindle or Reader.

    - Writing raw notes helps keep auto-pilot at bay. It takes a few second to think through and put something in your own words.
    - After finishing a chapter/section is a great time to do this. Try to recall what the most important points are that you just consumed. Imagine explaining it to someone. Then go back and fill in whatever details you were missing.
    - This step can be inconvenient while traveling or away from a laptop. It isn't fully necessary but it helps you to initially process everything and to have something to look back at in the future.
    - Try your best to avoid the [Collector's Fallacy](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/collectors-fallacy/).

3. [Create spaced repetition prompts](https://andymatuschak.org/prompts/) (I use Anki) of important points while consuming and looking back over notes/original texts.

    - Spaced repetition is often maligned with remembering rote details. However, it can be treated like note taking for things that you want to remember. The notes are then in the form of questions and answers instead of just statements. See [Michael Nielsen's demonstration of this](http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html).

4. Shift from note-taking to note-making. Spend time off-line, writing [evergreen-style](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes) notes with original thoughts. The goal at this point is to shift from consuming information to creating knowledge*.

5. [Allow ideas to marinate](). Review Anki prompts and Readwise daily.

    - This is the most underrated aspect of spaced repetition. We are what we think about. Prompts become the ideal way to consistently bring attention back to the ideas we want to be thinking about.

Interspersed through these: [Go on walks](). Think things through without the source material at hand. Ask questions and answer them. Talk to others. Podcast. Tweet. Do something cool with your new knowledge.

### Notes

I've often found myself passively going through these steps, especially when tired. I don't think it's bad to work when we're not fully there**, although it can be useful to take breaks or choose to [work on other things](https://jakobgreenfeld.com/personal-productivity).

*Knowledge is information with context and connection. Information is dead. Knowledge has meaning.

**I find it a useful time for first-reads and scaffold-building.
