*Note: If you take anything out of this. Look into spaced repetition. Links below.*

**Most schools never explictly teach us how to learn.** That's pretty incredible given that many of us spend 19-20 years in them.

Two examples. One, they don't teach us how to remember something for as long as we would like. And two, they generally don't teach us how to learn on our own, outside the classroom.

Those things are hinted at, but the ability to do them well is often seen as a trait that we have or that we don't. Geniuses seem to be geniuses and the rest of us, we're just, well us.

In the last few weeks, I've realized how false that is. Below is a system incorporating what I've thus far learned about learning. I hope you find it useful.

### Goals

To learn. **To choose what you would like to remember and remember it**. To develop a system that brings ideas back into attention that would otherwise have been lost to the [forgetting curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve). To be able to explain to people what it is that you're learning and why they should care. To think creatively and originally.

### Process

1. **Consciously commit** to learning about something for a set amount of time (shorter when initially digging in, longer as time goes on). Decide when to reconsider whether or not it's worth continuing. Be at peace with the fear of missing out that committing creates.

2. [Take raw notes](https://granthale.com/books) while consuming. Highlight memorable ideas in Kindle or Reader.

    - Writing raw notes helps keep auto-pilot at bay. It takes a few second to think through and put something in your own words.
    - **After finishing a chapter/section/few pages is a great time to do this**. Try to recall what the most important points are that you just consumed. Imagine explaining it to someone. Then go back and fill in whatever details you were missing.
    - This step can be inconvenient while traveling or away from a laptop. If you don't have access to paper or your notes, you can just do it mentally.
    - This step helps you to initially process everything and to have something to look back at in the future.
    - Try your best to avoid the [Collector's Fallacy](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/collectors-fallacy/).

3. [Create spaced repetition prompts](https://andymatuschak.org/prompts/) (I use [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)) of important points while consuming and looking back over notes/original texts.

    - Spaced repetition is often just seen as a way to remember obscure details. But it's incredibly powerful if used correctly. **Think about it as a leveled-up version of note-taking**. And unlike notes, these prompts will continue to come back right before you would normally forget them, so that you don't forget them. See [Michael Nielsen's demonstration of this](http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html).
    - It can be used to remember quotes, concepts, facts, tasks, questions you want to keep considering, and anything else you'd like!
    - The benefit is tremendous. **If you take nothing else from this, look into spaced repetition**. It turns memory into a choice, instead of something that feels beyond our control.

4. **Shift from note-taking to note-making**. Spend time off-line, writing [evergreen-style](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes) notes with original thoughts. The goal at this point is to shift from consuming information to creating knowledge*.

    - I've recently gotten into the [Zettelkasten method](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/). It's been a fantastic way to work with learning and produce novel insights. It focuses on connection of notes, and not collection. Some people refer to it as creating a second brain.
    - **Evergreen notes each have a single, atomic idea** (for the CS people out there, they're the equivalent of a single function). The goal is to be able to link between notes, tracing your knowledge, and building new ideas (the equivalent of combining atomic functions to create an entire program). They can then be reorganized, edited, reviewed and used to further your understanding.

5. **Allow ideas to marinate**. Review Anki prompts and Readwise daily, and think about the concepts. Note where you don't understand something and where you'd like to know more.

    - This is the most underrated aspect of spaced repetition. We are what we think about. Prompts become the ideal way to consistently bring attention back to the ideas we want to be thinking about.
    - Want to learn about physics? Entrepeneurship? Music theory? Japanese? Nolan Ryan's pitching workouts? Start with basic information, and day by day continue to build your knowledge on top of them. The cool thing is that, used correctly, you'll actually remember things top to bottom.

And finally, **interspersed through these steps:** Go on walks. Think things through concepts without the source material at hand. Ask questions. Answer them. Talk to others. Podcast. Tweet. Do something cool with your new knowledge. And as always, stay curious!

### Wrapping up

With all that said, let's come back to the two original examples of what school doesn't prepare us for. 

1. **To remember things**, take notes and think through the material upfront. Write spaced repetition prompts to continue to revisit the ideas and avoid the dreaded forgetting curve. Then grapple with the information to create new ideas. These ideas don't have to be fully original, but they shouldn't be something that you've read before. They should be new to you.
2. **To learn something fully on your own** is a bigger question. Following what I've outlined here and being rigorous in evaluating how much you actually understand can be great first steps in that direction.

Like any system, I built this one up through trial-and-error over time. **If you're looking to start with one of these steps, start with Anki.** It's been the most game changing addition for me, and something that is criminally over-looked.

### Notes

I've often found myself passively going through these steps, especially when tired. I don't think it's bad to work when we're not fully there**, although it can be useful to take breaks or choose to [work on other things](https://jakobgreenfeld.com/personal-productivity).

*Knowledge is information with context and connection. Information is dead. Knowledge has meaning.

**I find it a useful time for first-reads and scaffold-building.
