Paul Graham splits people into [makers and managers](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html), and Michael Gerber into [technicians, managers, and entrepreneurs](https://www.amazon.com/Myth-Revisited-Small-Businesses-About/dp/0887307280) (more generally I prefer thinkers).

It's not that each each of us is only one. It's that each of us can choose to embody tendencies from each.

- The makers (or technicians) in each of us are the ones building things. They're socializing, coding, podcasting, reading, writing. They're the ones selling. They perform the day-to-day operations of living and working. However, they're also the most myopic.
- The manager in each of us switches on when we're paying bills, scheduling, managing relationships. They keep the ship moving in the right direction, although they too cannot see very far ahead.
- The thinker in each of us is the visionary. They're the ones musing. They're the ones asking "what if X, then Y?" They're the ones that can work through where we should be headed and we often disregard them in when caught up daily to-dos.

Each day, we have the option to be a maker, manager, and/or thinker. Often we're all three.
It's been useful for me to think about how I split time between these categories.
Choose your players wisely, hone their individual skills as you will.
