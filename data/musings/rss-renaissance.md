**Make your own feed.**

This time, make it free of short-lived inspirations, hot-takes and selfies.
Include durable, thoughtful, question-raising content. Put your favorite authors, blogs, news websites, podcasts, and Youtube channels in one place.

You are what you eat. Choose a better information diet.

RSS - Really Simple Syndication makes this possible. In an age of increasingly diverse inputs, it's indeed a "really simple" solution. Sign up for one of the many free apps, and link to who you would like to see.

There are a plethora of options out there. The important thing is to just choose a tool and get started. I use Reader by Readwise. Check out my influences page if you're looking for interesting websites to add and let me know how it works for you!
