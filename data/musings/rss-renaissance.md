Make your own feed. Make your own what? Feed, like the social media kind.

This time, make it free of short-lived inspirations, hot-takes and selfies. This time include durable, thoughtful, question-raising content.

Include your favorite authors, bloggers, podcasters, and Youtubers all in one place.

It would be an intellectual breeding ground, a knowledge stream, a curiosity-inducing deluge.
Even better, you no longer have to check a multitude of apps. Everything should be in one place.

RSS - Really Simple Syndication (it's been around since the early 2000s) makes this possible.

In an age of increasingly diverse inputs, it's indeed a "really simple" solution. Sign up for one of the many free apps, and invite your favorite creator's to join you.

You are what you eat. Improve your diet. RSS is a way to improve the quality of your inputs.
