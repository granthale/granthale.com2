1. Consciously [commit](../writing/commitment) to what I'm learning for a set amount of time. Decide when I'll reconsider whether or not it's worth continuing. Be at peace with the FOMO that this creates.

2. [Take notes](https://granthale.com/books) as I go. Highlight memorable ideas in Kindle or through Reader.

3. Create [spaced repetition prompts](../writing/spaced-repetition-prompts) of things that I'd like to remember as I go, and while looking back over notes/ideas.

4. Write [evergreen-style](../writing/evergreen) pieces with original thoughts.

5. Continue to review spaced-repetition prompts and Readwise highlights. [Allow ideas to marinate over time](../writing/revisit-ideas).

Throughout. [Go on walks](../writing/walk). Podcast. Tweet. Think things through. Talk to others.
