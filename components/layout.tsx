                  üëã Welcome! I believe that everyone has room for more
                  curiosity, more wonder, and more creativity. I‚Äôm on a mission
                  to hone those qualities in myself and help others do the same.
                  Recently graduated the University of Illinois with a degree in
                  finance and a passion for computer science. Currently co-host
                  a podcast called Surface Tension that aims to expose cool
                  perspectives on the world around us. Don‚Äôt love the word ‚Äúi‚Äù,
                  looking for my post-i calling. Working on creating things,
                  meeting smart, ambitious, kind people, and building a better
                  character.
