## Introduction

### There are four obstacles to following your dreams

1. Told from childhood on that everything we want to do is impossible
2. We know what we want to do, but are afraid of hurting those around us
3. Fear of defeats along the way (while caring about the result)
4. Fear of realizing the dream that we have fought for our whole life (we feel we do not deserve to achieve our goal, or worry about losing purpose)

> 

> “One could open a book to any page, or look at a person’s hand; one could turn a card, or watch the flight of the birds … whatever the thing observed, one could find a connection with his experience of the moment.
